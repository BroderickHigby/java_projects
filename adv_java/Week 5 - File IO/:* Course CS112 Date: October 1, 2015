/* Course CS112 Date: October 1, 2015

 *Chapter Number: 10 Project HO 1

 *Programmer: Broderick Higby

 *Program Title: Integers

 *Program Description: Write a program that reads a file of numbers of type int 

 * and outputs all the numbers to

 * another file, but without any duplicate numbers. Assume that the input file 

 * is sorted from smallest first to largest last. After the program is run, 

 *  the new file will contain all the numbers in the original file, 

 * but no number will appear more than once in the file. The numbers in the 

 *  output file should also be sorted from smallest to largest.

 *  Your program should obtain both file names from the user. Use a text file 

 *  that stores one number per line.

 * 

 *Algorithm:

 * 1. Declare all the necessary variables

 * 2. Use scanner to ask the user to input the file name 

 * 3. Take the users text file name and assign it to a FileInputStream

 * 4. Read in int numbers from a text file

 * 5. Check them in an array 

 * 6. Check for duplicate numbers in a while loop

 * 7. Write the numbers to an output text file

 * 8. Ask the user if they want to restart the program

 * 9.   End the streams and close the program
